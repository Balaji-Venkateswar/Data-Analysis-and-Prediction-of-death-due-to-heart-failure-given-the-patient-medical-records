## Prediction of death event due to heart failure given the patient's medical records.
This is a binary classification problem, predicting whether the patient had died or not given the medical records. This dataset contains the medical records of 5000 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.
Features: age: age of the patient in years; anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (binary); creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L); diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (binary); ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage); high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (binary); platelets: platelets count (kiloplatelets/mL); sex: woman or man (binary); serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL); serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L); smoking: if the patient smokes or not (binary); time: follow-up period (days); (Target) DEATH_EVENT: if the patient died during the follow-up period (binary);

In this project, we perform data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis to understand the data distributions, correlations and remove any outliers present. Since this a classification problem, we used some classical algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Support-Vector classification to develop a model and make predictions.
